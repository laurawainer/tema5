   	<h1>About The coffee place</h1>
   	<p>
   		The coffee place was founded in 2014 by two friends with a passion for colorful and beautiful food. They where tired that at all the good places the food did not look interesting and in all the places with beautiful food it did not taste of anything.

   	</p>

   	<p>
They wanted to create inspiring settings and a place for people to come together and enjoy each others company, and some delicious food.
